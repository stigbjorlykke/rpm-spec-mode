RPM spec file editing commands for Emacs/XEmacs

This fork exists because I wanted the font lock faces to use common Emacs
values instead of the original developer chosen ones. I often run emacs with
no customization of temporary dev hosts but I can control what elisp is
installed during system imaging.
